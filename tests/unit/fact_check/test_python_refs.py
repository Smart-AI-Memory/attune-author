"""Tests for the python-refs check.

Uses real ``importlib`` against stdlib + attune_author modules
so the test exercises the same code path as production. The
regression fixture for ``attune.ops._readers`` (the ops-dashboard
class of bug) is documented in the docstring of each test —
those paths really don't exist in the active venv, which is
exactly the behavior the check is designed to catch.
