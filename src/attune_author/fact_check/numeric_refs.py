"""Check numeric claims in prose against verifiable counts.

For each sentence matching ``<digits> <noun>`` where the noun
is in our verifier map, compare the stated count against a
filesystem or manifest derived ground truth. Unverifiable
nouns surface as ``warning`` so the human can confirm.

The noun-to-resolver map is intentionally small and extensible
— per spec §1.5.1, additional resolvers can be added per
consumer without touching this module's structure.
