"""Per-page maintenance contract for regeneration safety.

A documentation page declares how it is maintained in its frontmatter::

    maintenance: auto | manual | hybrid

- ``auto`` (the default, and what an absent field means) — fully
  generated; regen may overwrite freely.
- ``manual`` — human-owned; regen never overwrites it (drift is
  reported, not corrected). The legacy ``status: manual`` field is
  honored as an alias so existing hand-written pages keep working.
- ``hybrid`` — a generated baseline with hand-written regions fenced
  by ``<!-- attune:manual:start -->`` / ``<!-- attune:manual:end -->``.
  Regen rewrites everything OUTSIDE the fences and preserves the text
  INSIDE them.

Why the contract is load-bearing: staleness is detected by content
hash, so a human-edited page always looks "drifted." Without this
contract the regen loop would overwrite curated pages. The merge is
deliberately conservative — matched fence pairs only — and **fails
safe**: if the regenerated content and the on-disk file don't share
the same fence structure, the on-disk hand-written text is never
dropped. The caller keeps the existing file instead.

This mirrors the conservative matched-fence approach of
:func:`attune_author.polish._strip_wrapping_fence` (the 0.16/0.17
fence-strip fix).
