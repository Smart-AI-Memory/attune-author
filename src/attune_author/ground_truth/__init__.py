"""Ground-truth context injection for the polish pass.

Phase 2 of the polish-fact-check spec
(``docs/specs/polish-fact-check``). Builds and injects authoritative
surface details (CLI ``--help`` output, public API signatures,
dataclass fields) into the polish prompt so the LLM has to anchor
on real names instead of inventing them.

The fact-check pass (Phase 1) catches mistakes after the fact.
This phase prevents them by changing what the model sees.
